# 👋 Hello, I'm Alfred Tran!

I'm a passionate computer science graduate from Cal Poly SLO, where my studies focused on computer vision and autonomous systems. I'm excited to share my journey in the world of technology.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I graduated in December 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
- 🔍 **Areas of Interest:** Computer vision, robotics, machine learning, data science, embedded systems, and full stack development.
- 🤖 I enjoy building intelligent systems that bridge the digital and physical world — whether it's a self-driving car, autonomous drone, or an engaging web experience.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### 🧾 [SafePlate Technologies](https://safeplate.tech) – Contract Developer
- Leading frontend development using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Building a responsive UI based on Figma designs to deliver food safety data to users.
- Developing a **KivyMD-based GUI** for custom testing devices used in allergen detection.
- Conducting **data analysis and visualization** from device-generated logs to support real-time decision-making and reporting.

## 🔬 Notable Past Work

- 🛩️ **Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project**  
  Developed computer vision and geolocation algorithms for an autonomous drone. Detected ground objects from ~190 ft altitude and integrated real-world coordinate calculations with Pixhawk PX4 and `asyncio`-based flight control.

- 🚗 **Quanser Self-Driving Car Competition**  
  As a researcher for Cal Poly's Cyber-Physical Systems Lab, I designed traffic sign/light detection with YOLOv5 and TensorRT on a Jetson TX2 and integrated the vision pipeline with our control systems. My undergraduate team placed top 10 in an international competition, outperforming teams with graduate students. 

- 🧠 **Lung Cancer Prediction (ML)**  
  Built supervised ML models using scikit-learn to predict risk levels. Focused on model accuracy and feature selection in a healthcare context.

## 🧰 Skills & Tools

**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript, C  
**Frameworks:** React, Flask, Node.js, KivyMD, Kivy
**AI/ML:** YOLOv5, OpenCV, TensorRT, TensorFlow Lite  
**Embedded/Robotics:** Nvidia Jetson, Raspberry Pi, PX4, MAVSDK  
**Dev Tools:** Git, Docker, Vite, VS Code, Linux  
**UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Figma, React Three Fiber, Three.js
